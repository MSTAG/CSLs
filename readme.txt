This is a .CSL (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_Style_Language) that we use to convert entries in Zotero to a Dspace-import-ready .csv. We use this tool to populate our repository with faculty citations.  These citations are entered by identifier, through Scopus exports, or by hand.  

Add style to Zotero. Select citations to include. Output Bibliography to clipboard in Zotero using this style. Paste contents onto the second line of CSLPREFIX.txt and save as a .csv. Obviously, this requires a lot of cleanup before importing into Dspace, and is highly customized to our setup. 

Style can be tweaked through the Visual CSL Editor (http://editor.citationstyles.org/visualEditor/).
